# Fabula Ultima (Unofficial) for Foundry VTT

A fan-made system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop to implement the ruleset for _Fabula Ultima_, a TTJRPG published by NEED GAMES!

This system is unaffiliated with the creators or the publisher. Details about the Fabula Ultima system and links to support the creators and purchase the rulebook are available on [their website.](https://www.needgames.it/fabula-ultima-en/)

## Status

This project is in active development and may still change at any time. That being said, all I have planned is minor visual stuff and some UI elements. As well as fixing any bugs I might find.

### Future Content

If/when new DLC or expansion modules are released for Fabula Ultima, I will probably get around to adding it in eventually. Certain things I will not be adding, such as major mechanic variants. I know there's something on the creator's Patreon about class spheres and that would be a large departure from what I've made, so I will not implement that, for example.

## Installation

You probably shouldn't install this system right now. It barely functions and is in very early stages of development.

But if you must, manually install this system by downloading the folder and placing it in your `Foundry/Data/Systems` folder. Make sure to rename the folder to `fabulaultima` or it won't work.
