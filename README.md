# Fabula Ultima (Unofficial) for Foundry VTT

A fan-made system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop to implement the ruleset for _Fabula Ultima_, a TTJRPG published by NEED GAMES!

This system is unaffiliated with the creators or the publisher. Details about the Fabula Ultima system and links to support the creators and purchase the rulebook are available on [their website.](https://www.needgames.it/fabula-ultima-en/)

## Status

This project is in active development and may change significantly at any time. As of now, you can:

-   Create a character with _most_ of their data available in a bad layout.
-   Create and equip weapons and roll their associated accuracy check.
-   Create and equip classes that modify HP/MP/IP and store a level that the player can edit.

## Installation

You probably shouldn't install this system right now. It barely functions and is in very early stages of development.

But if you must, manually install this system by downloading the folder and placing it in your `Foundry/Data/Systems` folder. Make sure to rename the folder to `fabulaultima` or it won't work.
