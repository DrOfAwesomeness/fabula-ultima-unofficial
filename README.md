# Fabula Ultima (Unofficial) for Foundry VTT

A fan-made system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop to implement the ruleset for _Fabula Ultima_, a TTJRPG published by NEED GAMES!

## Status

This project is in active development and may still change at any time. That being said, all I have planned is minor visual stuff and some UI elements. As well as fixing any bugs I might find.

### Future Content

If/when new DLC or expansion modules are released for Fabula Ultima, I will probably get around to adding it in eventually. Certain things I will not add myself, such as major mechanic variants. I know there's something on the creator's Patreon about class spheres and that would be a large departure from what I've made, so I will not implement that, for example.

I am working on a basic implementation of the Ace of Cards. GMs won't enjoy running it, especially if there's multiple players using that class.

## Installation

In order to install this system, you will need to download this repository as a zip file and extract it to your foundry/systems folder. Alternatively, you can use the url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/razage/fabula-ultima-unofficial/master/system.json` in the "Manifest URL" field when you click "Install System"

### Recommended Modules

I've added a few modules that will make running this game _much_ easier. They are not required to operate, so I made them recommended. Here's my reasoning for each.

-   Challenge Tracker
    -   This game uses clocks. This is my preferred clock plugin. Use whatever one you prefer if you don't want to use this. My system does **not** implement clocks otherwise.
-   Lancer Initiative
    -   Fabula Ultima's initiative system is largely incompatible with Foundry. My implementation sucked, so I found this as a good alternative. With this, you just need to use the party sheet to make an initiative roll (DEX + INS) and compare it to the highest enemy initiative. It even lets you give bosses multiple turns.
