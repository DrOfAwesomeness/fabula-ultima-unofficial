## Status

This project is in active development and may still change at any time. That being said, all I have planned is minor visual stuff and some UI elements. As well as fixing any bugs I might find.

### Future Content

If/when new DLC or expansion modules are released for Fabula Ultima, I will probably get around to adding it in eventually. Certain things I will not add myself, such as major mechanic variants. I know there's something on the creator's Patreon about class spheres and that would be a large departure from what I've made, so I will not implement that, for example.

I am working on a basic implementation of the Ace of Cards. GMs won't enjoy running it, especially if there's multiple players using that class.
