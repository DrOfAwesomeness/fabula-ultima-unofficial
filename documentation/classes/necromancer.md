# Necromancer

The Necromancer is a class that was added in a bonus PDF available for free on the (creator's website.)[https://www.needgames.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fabula-Ultima-Bonus-01-Necromancer.pdf] Its abilities allow it to be useful for physical and magic damage dealing builds. The implications and theme of this class may make it not fit certain worlds, so be sure to ask your Game Master first.

## Grave Points

This is a resource used exclusively by the Necromancer for various abilities. It is hidden by default on the character sheet. To unlock this resource, you need to give the character the "Beyond the Realms of Death" skill. As the skill stipulates, you may never have more than [SL + 1] Grave Points, so the max a player can ever have is 6.

Due to how I handled this, I cannot dynamically adjust the max amount of GP. I set it to the max that's currently possible by default. GMs and players will have to keep in mind how many points they _actually_ can have at any given time.

## Skills

### Birth of the Cruel

This heroic skill lets the player revive a non-villain enemy (must be beast, humanoid, monster, or plant type) as their minion. It makes a bunch of adjustments, so the Game Master will have to adjust its stat block accordingly.

As part of this process, the player's maximum HP and MP will be decreased depending on the NPC's level. I handle this by adding the "HP and MP Penalty" spell effect to the character. The GM can make a copy of this effect and modify its numbers to be correct, then add it to the character. Due to how Foundry handles this, you cannot edit this number from the character sheet. If this UI seems too complicated, you can also add the effect more than once to reach the number you need. Each copy of the effect lowers HP and MP by 5.

### Pulse of Maggots

This heroic skill gives the player a bunch of resistances and a vulnerability, as long as they have at least 1 Grave Point. These are intended to override **ANY** other resistances they get from other items or effects. There may be some edge cases that I didn't account for, so please let me know if you find any strange combos that make this not work.

The skill does not activate these resistances when equipped. The player must go to the effects tab and add the "Pulse of Magics" spell effect. This will not be removed or added automatically, so players will have to manage that themselves.
