## Skills

### Focused

This gives you a bonus to your MP and to Open Checks using [INS + INS]. You can adjust your MP by adding the "MP +3" spell effect on the effects tab once for each rank of this skill. Open Checks would be rolled on the Roll tab, and you'll have to remember to enter your skill rank as a bonus before clicking the roll button.

### Knowledge is Power

This skill lets you swap out one of the stats on a weapon's accuracy check for INS. This can be done by modifying your weapons accordingly.
