## Skills

### Condemn

This skill lets you make an opposed [INS + WLP] check to make your enemy lose MP and suffer a condition. This roll is managed by the "Condemn" spell, although it is **not** actually a spell. You will need to adjust the bonus to its accuracy check based on your skill rank.

### Encourage

This skill lets you heal another creature and give them a bonus of one die to a stat. The target will need to manually apply the heal. Then, they can equip the "Awaken (x)" spell effect on the effects tab depending on what stat you give them.

### My Trust in You

This skill lets you spend a Fabula point to allow another character to reroll or improve a check they made. If you have a bond with that character, you also recover MP. Both of these effects would need to be handled manually.
