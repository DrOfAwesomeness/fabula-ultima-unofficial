# Arcanist

This is a core class. I normally don't make notes for core classes, but for my own sanity and to help you guys: Arcana is plural, Arcanum is singular.

## Skills

### Arcane Regeneration

This skill recovers HP when an Arcanum is summoned. Arcanum are not treated as NPCs in my system and nothing heals/hurts the player automatically, so this will need to be done manually.

### Bind and Summon

This skill allows the Arcanist to bind and summon Arcana. This section is hidden by default and unlocked when this skill is equipped. The Arcana section is under the Spells on the "Spells" tab.

When you click the edit button on an arcanum, it opens its item page which is mostly editable from the character sheet. Stuff under the effect tab is not editable on the character sheet due to Foundry's implementation of ActiveEffects. To customize that, you will have to create a new arcanum (under items) or drag the arcanum from the character sheet onto the sidebar, then edit it and drag it back to the character. That system modifies stats and resistances. If your arcanum does not need to do that, you can ignore the effects tab.

Arcana are supposed to be flavored towards your world. You may want to rename or reimagine the default ones accordingly. I added all of the ones from the book, which should act as good examples. The "Merge" effect is triggered by "equipping" the arcanum in question. This is done by clicking the checkbox on the character sheet. Dismiss effects are activated when you "unequip" an arcanum. These usually deal static damage or create some kind of effect. These are not handled automatically, so you will need to tell your GM what happens during combat.

### Emergency Arcanum

This skill reduces the MP cost of summoning Arcana when the player is in Crisis. Since spells do not automatically deduct Mind Points, the player will have to calculate this accordingly.

### Ritual Arcanism

Rituals are pretty much exclusively story-based and up to interpretation, so these are not handled by the system at all. You can go to the "Roll" tab on the character sheet to make your check and discuss with your GM what is/isn't allowed.
