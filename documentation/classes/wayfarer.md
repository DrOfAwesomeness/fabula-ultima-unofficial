# Wayfarer

## Skills

### Faithful Companion

This skill gives you a pet, with a bunch of stipulations. The GM will need to create a companion actor and assign it to you. The sheet will manage HP and MP correctly.

### Resourceful

This skill causes you to regain IP while traveling. IP adjustments aren't done automatically, so this needs to be handled manually.

### Treasure Hunter

This skill makes you have discoveries more often. This is mainly a story thing, so it is handled manually.

### Well-Traveled

This skill reduces your travel roll die by one size. This roll isn't automated, so you'll just have to remember which die to roll.
