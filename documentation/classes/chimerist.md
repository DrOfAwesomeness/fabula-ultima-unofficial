# Chimerist

## Skills

### Consume

The system does not track HP/MP increases or decreases, so players will have to manage this MP regen manually. As well as making sure they have the right type of weapon.

### Ritual Chimerism

Rituals are pretty much exclusively story-based and up to interpretation, so these are not handled by the system at all. You can go to the "Roll" tab on the character sheet to make your check and discuss with your GM what is/isn't allowed.

### Spell Mimic

This skill lets the player steal spells from NPCs of the beast, monster, or plant type. There is a heroic skill that allows this skill to work on additional types. Players decide whether they want to use [INS + WLP] or [MIG + WLP] for the Magic Check, and this is automatically applied to all spells they steal. By default, the player can have [SL + 2] different spells, for a max of 12. They can also forget spells to learn new ones. The system does not limit the number of spells, so players will have to keep in mind how many of these spells they can actually have.

To facilitate this, the GM can drag a spell from the enemy in question to the player's character sheet. The player can then edit its parameters to match their own. For instance, the accuracy check _must_ be changed to whatever set of stats they originally selected (mentioned above.) The class should be set to whatever monster you got it from, for the sake of remembering that later.
