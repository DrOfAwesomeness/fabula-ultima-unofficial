# Fury

## Skills

### Adrenaline

This skill increases your damage dealt while in Crisis. Crisis is not a toggle in my system, so this has to be handled manually.

### Frenzy

This skill causes you to critically hit way more often with certain weapon types. Upon equipping this skill, the system will handle the rest.

### Provoke

This skill lets you make a check to "taunt" an enemy, forcing them to attack you and giving them the "enraged" debuff. I've added a spell called "Provoke" to handle this roll for you. You will have to adjust it based on your skill rank. It is **not** actually a spell, but this is the best way for me to add it in my system.

### Withstand

This skill lets you choose not to provide cover while Guarding and instead recover HP and increase your MIG or WLP by 1 die size. HP adjustments aren't managed so this will have to be done manually. The stat adjustment can be done by adding the "Awaken (MIG)" or "Awaken (WLP)" spell effect to your character on the effects tab.
