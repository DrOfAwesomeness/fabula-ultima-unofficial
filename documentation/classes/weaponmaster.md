# Weaponmaster

## Skills

### Bladestorm

This skill lets you spend 10 MP to do a multi attack or increase your multi by 1. You can temporarily change your weapon to reflect the correct multi level and deduct the MP manually.

### Bone Crusher

This skill lets you choose to do no damage with an attack to instead do something else. You will have to make an attack as normal, and just note that the damage number isn't applied.

### Breach

This skill lets you choose to deal no damage with a free attack against a single target. For doing so, you can either destroy their armor, destroy their shield, or make them take extra damage from all additional attacks before your next turn. None of this is managed, so you will have to do things manually. The GM can delete the armor and/or shield on the enemy, if they have one. If not, you'll have to remember the bonus damage for all the following attacks.

### Counterattack

This skill lets you make a free attack if the enemy hits or misses you with an even number for their accuracy check. This isn't automated, so you'll have to click the roll button on your equipped melee weapon. You will have to expand the result so you know what your [HR] is, since that has to be 0 for this skill.

### Melee Weapon Mastery

This skill increased your accuracy with melee weapons. The bonus is applied by adding the "Melee Weapon Mastery" spell effect under the effects tab. You should apply it once per skill rank.
