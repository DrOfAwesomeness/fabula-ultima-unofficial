## Skills

### Gadgets

This skill lets you specialize in three different skills. Each skill has 3 levels, but you can only take this skill 5 times. You will take this skill and level it up accordingly, then pick your specialization skills and track their levels as well. I have creeated roll tables to make things easier to manage, but I do deviate slightly from the rules.

For example, the Alchemy skill has you roll 3 d20s and pick your favorites. I'm not sure how to implement something that flexible, so I've worded the skill as rolling "2 targets or 2 effects, and 1 of the other." So you still get 3 d20s, but you have to choose which you want more flexibility with ahead of time.

#### Magitech Override

This is implemented as a spell. Add it to your spells tab for convenience.

#### Magicannon

This is implemented as a weapon. Equip and and change the damage type to match your selection.

#### Magispheres

This isn't directly implemented. You should go to your spell tab and select however many spells you're allowed to have. You'll have to make a note or remember that each of those spells **also** costs 2 Inventory Points to use.

### Potion Rain

This skill allows potions you create to affect up to 3 creatures for half the benefit. HP and MP adjustments are not handled by the system, so this must be done manually.

### Secret Formula

This skill increases the effect of any created potions, magispheres, or elemental shards. HP and MP adjustments are not handled by the system, so this must be done manually.

### Visionary

This skill gives you some free value on Projects and daily progression. Projects would be story-oriented in nature, for the most part, so this should be handled manually.
