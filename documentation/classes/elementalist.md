# Elementalist

## Skills

### Cataclysm

This skill allows the player to deal more damage with spells if they spend more MP, as long as they have an arcane weapon equipped. These adjustments could be displayed on the character sheet if the player wants to edit their spells, but ultimately this is handled manually.

### Magical Artillery

This skill gives you a bonus to your Magic Check based on its level if you have an arcane weapon equipped. If you are mostly using arcane weapons, this is easiest to manage by editing your spells accordingly. If you use other types of weapons, you'll have to remmeber this bonus and apply it manually.

### Ritual Elementalism

Rituals are pretty much exclusively story-based and up to interpretation, so these are not handled by the system at all. You can go to the "Roll" tab on the character sheet to make your check and discuss with your GM what is/isn't allowed.

### Spellblade

This skill lets you cast a spell through your weapon, using the weapon's accuracy check instead of your magic check. There are a lot of stipulations to which spells and what weapon types are allowed, and these must be verified manually. The easiest way to manage this would either be changing your spells to reflect this or creating a copy of each spell and having the copy reflect your weapon's accuracy check.
