# Ace of Cards

The Necromancer is a class that was added in a bonus PDF available for free on the (creator's website.)[https://www.needgames.it/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fabula-Bonus-Ace-of-Cards.pdf] Its abilities allow it to be useful for physical and magic damage dealing builds. This class requires a lot of management and will be overwhelming for your GM, especially if multiple players want to use it. Make sure your GM is ok with that before using this class.

## Cards

The core feature of this class is using a specialized deck of cards. You can use a normal deck of cards, but certain ones will have to be removed. It would be easier to manage this by using a real deck of cards simultaneously, but this will require the GM to trust players doing so. If this is not feasible, Foundry can manage decks of cards, and information about that is below.

### Foundry

Each player with the Ace of Cards class will need a deck of elements, a hand, and a discard pile. I've created these in the compendium "Ace of Cards Support". You will probably want to organize these in folders if you have more than one Ace of Cards. The main problem is that the deck of elements will either be viewable to its owner (meaning they can see the order of the cards), or they won't be able to shuffle their own deck.

If you are ok with shuffling their decks, you'll want to set their permission to "limited" on the deck. Otherwise they should be made the "owner" of their discard pile and hand. If you don't mind them (potentially) viewing the order of the cards, just set all 3 to "owner" permissions.
