# Spiritist

## Skill

### Healing Power

This skill increases healing while you have an arcane weapon equipped. The amount is based on skill level and bonds. This amount is not calculated by the sheet and you will have to remember the bonus when casting heals. Health adjustments are not handled by the system, so healing is manual regardless.

### Ritual Spiritism

Rituals are pretty much exclusively story-based and up to interpretation, so these are not handled by the system at all. You can go to the "Roll" tab on the character sheet to make your check and discuss with your GM what is/isn't allowed.

### Support Magic

This skill grants a bonus equal to bond strength to a character you have a bond with if you cast a spell with an arcane weapon on one or more allies. Spells don't directly "cast" on allies or NPCs in this system, so anything here would be handled manually.

### Vismagus

This skill lets you spend 2x the HP instead of MP to cast spell. HP and MP adjustments are not handled automatically, so this is done manually.
