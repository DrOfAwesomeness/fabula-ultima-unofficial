# Entropist

## Skills

### Absorb MP

This skill lets you recover MP when you take damage. Changes to HP/MP are not managed, so you will have to do this manually.

### Lucky Number

This skill lets you replace dice results with a stored number. This is not managed by the system, so you'll have to do it manually.

### Ritual Entropism

Rituals are pretty much exclusively story-based and up to interpretation, so these are not handled by the system at all. You can go to the "Roll" tab on the character sheet to make your check and discuss with your GM what is/isn't allowed.
