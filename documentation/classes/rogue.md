## Skills

### Cheap Shot

This skill lets you deal extra damage to a target if you are only hitting them and they have a status effect. This is not handled by the system, so you will have to remember to tell your GM about the bonus damage.

### Dodge

This skill gives you a bonus to defense as long as you aren't using armor or a shield. This restriction is not managed by the system, so keep that in mind. The stat adjustment can be applied with the "Defense +1" spell effect on the effects tab. Equip it multiple times, depending on your skill rank.

### Soul Steal

This skill allows you to recover some IP or get a treasure from an enemy if you succeed a [DEX + WLP] check. See the skill for more information, as there is a lot. I've added a spell "Soul Steal" to make rolling this skill very easy.
