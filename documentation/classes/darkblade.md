# Darkblade

## Skills

### Agony

This skill restores HP and MP to the player when they deal damage to an NPC they have a bond towards. Changes to HP and MP are not managed by the system, so players will need to apply this manually.

### Dark Blood

This skill gives you some resistances when you are in Crisis. Nothing toggles when you are in Crisis, so this needs to be managed manually. Players can go to the Effects tab and equip the "Dark Blood" spell effect to automatically apply this bonus.

### Shadow Strike

This skill allows the player to perform a special attack that does dark damage at the cost of some HP. All these rolls are possible to do with the character sheet, but there's not a shortcut to do so. HP changes are also not automated, so the player will have to adjust their HP accordingly. You could change the damage type of your weapon to dark temporarily, or you could just remember that it deals dark damage for this skill.
