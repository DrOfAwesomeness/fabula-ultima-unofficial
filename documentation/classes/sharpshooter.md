## Skills

### Barrage

This skill allows you to add multi to an attack or increase it to multi (3). The easiest way to handle this skill would be to temporarily edit your weapon to be multi (2) or (3).

### Hawkeye

This skill allows you to gain a bonus to damage or gain a free attack with an [HR] of 0 if you use the Guard action and choose not to provide cover. The damage bonus or free attack would have to be done manually.

### Ranged Weapon Mastery

This skill increases your accuracy with ranged weapons. You can apply this bonus by adding the "Ranged Weapon Mastery (+1)" spell effect once for every rank you have.
